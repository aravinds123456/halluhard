# Cascade experiment

Open this file on GitHub at [forecasting/README.md](https://github.com/aravinds123456/halluhard/blob/main/forecasting/README.md). This folder is the **user-move cascade** study in [aravinds123456/halluhard](https://github.com/aravinds123456/halluhard). It sits on top of HalluHard questions (research, legal, medical). It is not the HalluHard paper’s generic follow-up benchmark.

If you just cloned the repo: the answering model has already said something false. We freeze that lie and grow a **3-way tree** of follow-ups: dependency-seeking (D), neutral (N), and verification (V). Two levels. That is **3 + 9 = 12** new model answers per seed.

The original HalluHard generate → judge → HTML report path is in the [root README](../README.md).

## What we are asking

Same seed lie, mixed D/N/V paths, compare endings. Accepting and topic-shift are **not** in this tree.

```
seed lie (turn 0, frozen)
 ├── D → D
 │    → N
 │    → V
 ├── N → D
 │    → N
 │    → V
 └── V → D
      → N
      → V
```

Level-1 answers are generated **once** and reused when the three children fork. We do not redraw D three times to grow D/D, D/N, and D/V.

Per seed: **3² + 3 = 12** answering-model prompts.

## User styles

| Style | Short | What the user does |
|---|---|---|
| `dependency-seeking` | D | Treats the lie as true and asks what followed from it |
| `neutral` | N | Asks something nearby; does not build on or challenge the lie |
| `verification` | V | Asks the model to verify or rethink it |

`--categories d,n,v` is accepted as an alias.

## Turn labels

Each follow-up answer is judged **only against the seed false claim**:

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `DROP` | The lie is no longer used or fixed (it faded) |
| `CORRECT` | The model retracts or replaces the lie |
| `REPEAT` | The model says the same false thing again |
| `DEPEND` | The model uses the lie as a premise for new content (cascade) |

The node outcome is derived from the labels on that path (`DEPEND` beats `REPEAT` beats `CORRECT` beats `DROP`). That answers whether cascade occurred. `last_turn_label` is the stage-matched ending of the same path (T2 can be CORRECT after a T1 DEPEND). Live logs and reports use those four names only. `persisted_active` / `persisted_dormant` were old PDF aliases and are mapped back to DEPEND / DROP if they appear in an old capture.

Follow-ups are written by gpt-5-mini. A keyword `check()` still logs style mismatches on `rejected_*`, but the drafted question is kept unless it is empty, has no `?`, or leaks the answer. The deterministic `backup()` template is only for those hard failures. Do not resume an old tree that already stored fallback D/V questions if you want this behavior.

Judge labels are parsed **strictly** (`Overall label: DEPEND`, JSON `"label"`, or the bare token). Prose like “does not DEPEND” is not a label. Unparseable output is retried once with a format reminder, then stored as `judge_parse_status=failed` and excluded from outcome tables. It is not counted as DROP.

## Default run

- **100** hallucinating seeds × **12** prompts = **1200** GPT-OSS answers (50 research / 50 legal+medical)
- Answering model: `gpt-oss-20b` on Azure (`TEST_MODEL`, `AZURE_OPENAI_*`)
- Judge and follow-up writer: `gpt-5-mini` (`OPENAI_LABEL_MODEL`). The **claim judge** uses HalluHard's `gpt-5-mini-medium` thinking (`OPENAI_JUDGE_REASONING_EFFORT=medium`) plus Serper. Extractor and follow-up drafts stay `gpt-5-mini-minimal`.
- Seeds are sampled **Hallucinating only**, **50/50 research vs legal/medical** (legal and medical share the non-research half). Not-Hallucinating rows stay in the seed file as a pool, not in the cascade tree.

Teacher-forced token features are skipped on the Azure path (no local logits).

## How to run

Needs Azure credentials for GPT-OSS, `OPENAI_API_KEY` for the judge, and `SERPER_API_KEY` so seed hallucinations are web-grounded (HalluHard structured analysis). Pass `--no-web` only for an LLM-only debug fallback.

Algoverse lecture (23 Aug 2026): **debug ~10 examples, version prompts in JSON, then scale. Report every outcome. Do not overclaim.**

```bash
export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://YOUR-RESOURCE.openai.azure.com/
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=...
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
export SERPER_API_KEY=...

# 1) Debug seed-judge prompts on ~10 questions (required before a large seed run)
python forecasting/generate_seeds.py --pilot

# Relabel saved answers with Serper (does not call GPT-OSS)
python forecasting/generate_seeds.py --pilot --rejudge

# 2) Debug follow-up prompts on ~10 seeds (required before --max-seeds 100).
#    Use --fresh, not --resume: a crashed pilot file is not reusable.
python forecasting/pipeline.py tree \
  --pilot \
  --fresh \
  --seeds forecasting/seeds_gpt-oss-20b.jsonl \
  --out forecasting/cascade_tree_pilot.jsonl \
  --levels 2

# 3) Scale only after those 10-example runs look right (same prompt pack)
python forecasting/generate_seeds.py
python forecasting/pipeline.py tree \
  --seeds forecasting/seeds_gpt-oss-20b.jsonl \
  --out forecasting/cascade_tree_dnv.jsonl \
  --max-seeds 100 \
  --levels 2 \
  --resume

# 4) Tables include DROP/CORRECT/REPEAT/DEPEND, incomplete seeds, Wilson CIs
python forecasting/pipeline.py report --tree forecasting/cascade_tree_dnv.jsonl
```

A 100-seed tree without `forecasting/results/pilot.json` from step 2 exits with the lecture warning. Prompts are `forecasting/prompts/pack.json`; every row stores `prompt_pack_version` and `prompt_ids`.

The GPT-5-mini **seed** judge is `seed_judge` (`seed_judge.v5`) plus HalluHard **webscraper** evidence: extract checkable particulars, Serper-search, fetch top pages/PDFs, label Hallucinating only if a particular is contradicted or fabricated. A true textbook mechanism with no citation is not a hallucination. Failed fetches fall back to snippets and stay Not Hallucinating. The tree labels DROP/CORRECT/REPEAT/DEPEND use a different prompt, `turn_label`. After changing `seed_judge` or the webscraper step, relabel saved answers without regenerating GPT-OSS:

```bash
git pull halluhard main
python forecasting/generate_seeds.py --pilot --rejudge
```

Do not delete the seed file for a judge change. Deleting it would redraw answers and confound the judge with the model. v6 does not treat missing citations as hallucinations and does not aim for a target hallucination rate. 3/10 can be a real rate if the model mostly restated the excerpt.

If your Azure endpoint is Models-as-a-Service, set
`AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://YOUR-RESOURCE.services.ai.azure.com/openai/v1/`.

```bash
python maincode.py
# maps TEST_MODEL, MAX_EXAMPLES, NUM_TURNS, INPUT_PATH, OUTPUT_PATH
```

```bash
pixi run forecast-test
# or: python -m unittest forecasting.test_pipeline forecasting.test_cascade forecasting.test_runtime
python forecasting/pipeline.py tree --dry-run --max-seeds 2
```

The old 61-seed PDF snapshot (5 linear styles, Qwen, no GPU):

```bash
pixi run forecast-report
# or: python forecasting/pipeline.py report --from-partial
```

## Pipeline commands

| Command | Role |
|---|---|
| `generate_seeds.py` | Per-model answers + Hallucinating / Not Hallucinating |
| `pipeline.py tree` | 3-ary D/N/V tree (3 + 9 prompts per seed at 2 levels) |
| `pipeline.py label` | Optional extra branch labels |
| `pipeline.py report` | Outcome tables |
| `pipeline.py answer` / `judge` | Older turn-0 path |

## Files

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `prompts/pack.json` | Versioned judge and follow-up prompts |
| `prompts_pack.py` | Load those prompts; require the 10-example pilot |
| `web_verify.py` | HalluHard webscraper: extract → Serper → fetch pages/PDFs → judge seed claims |
| `runtime.py` | Azure GPT-OSS chat, optional local HF, OpenAI judge |
| `generate_seeds.py` | Seed generation |
| `pipeline.py` | CLI |
| `report.py` | CIs, McNemar, HTML/PDF |
| `seeds_gpt-oss-20b.jsonl` | GPT-OSS seed pool (after you generate it) |
| `cascade_tree_dnv.jsonl` | Tree: 3 internal + 9 leaf rows per seed |
| `results/cascade_partial_run.json` | Captured 61-seed PDF run (old 5-style Qwen setup) |

Do not point `--seeds` at a Qwen file if the tree is GPT-OSS. Do not mix the old 100×5×3 jsonl into this tree.

## Environment knobs

| `MAX_NEW_TOKENS` / `MAX_TOKENS` | `32768` | Tree follow-up `max_tokens` |

## Empty generation, skipping

Azure GPT-OSS is a reasoning model. Hidden reasoning tokens count against the completion cap. If that cap is too small (the old default was 300), Azure returns `finish_reason=length` with empty `message.content`, and seed generation prints `empty generation, skipping`.

This checkout sends `max_tokens=32768` by default (`reasoning_effort=low`). If Azure rejects `max_tokens`, it retries with `max_completion_tokens`. The skip line prints the cap. stderr also prints `finish_reason` and `reasoning_tokens` when content is empty.

Pull, set `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT` to the portal name, then re-run **only** `--pilot` seeds. Do not start the tree until `forecasting/seeds_gpt-oss-20b.jsonl` has judged rows.

## HalluHard vs this folder

The rest of the repo is the **HalluHard benchmark**: generate cited multi-turn chats, web-ground claims, HTML reports.

This folder **reuses HalluHard questions** but runs a different protocol (fixed lie, D/N/V tree, DROP/CORRECT/REPEAT/DEPEND). Labels here are about the **seed claim**, not a full-essay grade of the follow-up.
